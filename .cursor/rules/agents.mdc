# Agent guidelines (AGENTS.md)

When working in this repo, follow the project’s **AGENTS.md** at the repo root.

## Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun  
- **Backend**: Convex (`convex/`)  
- **Frontend**: TanStack Start (`src/routes/`), React, TypeScript  
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`)  
- **Auth**: Clerk (optional)

## Conventions

- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes; use `cn()` from `~/lib/utils` when merging classes. Global styles/theme in `src/styles/app.css`.
- **Convex**: Follow `.cursor/rules/convex_rules.mdc` (schema, validators, function registration, etc.).
- **shadcn**: Add components with `bunx shadcn@latest add <component>`, import from `~/components/ui/<component>`.- **UX**: Make sure the application is always in compliant with the "3 click" rule where users can get anywhere in the app (as long as they are authenticated) within 3 clicks.
-- **Data** all DateTimes must be stored in ms because of epoch but on the front end they must display as MM/DD/YYYY MIN:SEC
-- **Code Convention**: All files must have declarative, concise, and eloquent names, that are easy to digest and self explanatory

## Verification

- After changing Convex code (schema or functions), run **`bunx convex dev --once`** to verify and sync.

## Scripts

- `bun run dev` — Vite + Convex (port 3000)  
- `bun run build` / `bun run lint` / `bun run format` — build, lint, format  
- Env: `.env.local` from `.env.example`; `VITE_CONVEX_URL` required.
